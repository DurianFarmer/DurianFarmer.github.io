## Turing Machine
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)
- A **Turing machine** (or deterministic Turing machine) is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
- The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete "cells".
- In a **deterministic Turing machine (DTM)**, the set of rules prescribes at most one action to be performed for any given situation.

## Nondeterministic Turing machine
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_Turing_machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_Turing_machine)
- In contrast to a deterministic Turing machine, in a **nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM)** the set of rules may prescribe more than one action to be performed for any given situation.
- How does the NTM "know" which of these actions it should take?  … The other is to imagine that the machine "branches" into many copies, each of which follows one of the possible transitions.
- Whereas a DTM has a single "computation path" that it follows, an NTM has a "computation tree". If at least one branch of the tree halts with an "accept" condition, the NTM accepts the input.

## Computational Problem, Decision Problem
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem)
- A **computational problem** can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a set (possibly empty) of solutions for every instance.
- **Decision problems** are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0.
- Decision problems are a special case of computational problems.

## P & NP
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity))
- **P:** Set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time with a deterministic Turing machine
-**NP:** either one of the following
  - Set of decision problems for which the problem instances, where the answer is "yes", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine
  - Set of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine. 
  - Set of decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.

## NP-hard
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)

- A problem $H$ is **NP-hard** when every problem $L$ in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to $H$; that is, assuming a solution for $H$ takes 1 unit time, $H$'s solution can be used to solve $L$ in polynomial time.

- As a consequence, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve any NP-hard problem would give polynomial time algorithms for all the problems in NP.

- As it is suspected that $P \neq NP$, it is unlikely that such an algorithm exists.

## NP-complete
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness)

A problem is **NP-complete** if it is both in NP and NP-hard.
